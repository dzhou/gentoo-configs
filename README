While cleaning my digital archives, I stumpled upon the backup configs for the 
gentoo system that got me through my bachelors degree @ UPenn.
So I decided to jot down some notes and memories of a 5 year learning experience
with one of the best linux os.

My gentoo setup (the final cut as of early 2010):
* stage3 tarball base, completely recompiled with optimized gcc flags
* gentoo-sources patched with hibernate2 and reiser4 - manually compiled 
* flux window manager with lightest and mostly cmdline based toolsets 
    (the heaviest application I had was probably firefox and virtualbox)

Some of my favorites + frequently used
admin: conky, sudo, syslog-ng
editors: nano, vim 
emulation: wine, virtualbox
misc: screen 
media: feh, gimp, xzgv, mpc, mpd, ncmpc, mplayer 
net: arping, arpwatch, iptraf, netcat, nmap, tcpdump, traceroute, wireshark
sys: cpufreqd, hibernate, vixie-cron, ntfs3g
www: firefox, links, lighttpd
wm: fluxbox
wm-misc: xbindkeys, xscreensaver, slim
